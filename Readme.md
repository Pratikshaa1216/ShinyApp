## Shiny App for Real-Time Text Prediction
This project aims to build a Shiny app that can predict the next word based on a given input phrase, considering the environment of the text. The model has been trained using millions of lines of text data to provide real-time text prediction for three distinct writing styles.

## How to Use the App
1.Input a phrase in the text box provided on the app's interface.
2.Select one of the three writing styles (options available on the interface) for which you want to predict the next word.
3.Press "Submit" to obtain the predicted next word.

## Intelligent Pruning to Reduce Model Size
To improve the performance and reduce the size of the model, intelligent pruning has been implemented. As a result, the model size has been reduced by half, making it efficient and fast in real-time text prediction.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies have been used to build this project:

1.Python Programming Language
2.Shiny Web Framework
3-Intelligent Pruning Techniques

## Data Sources
The text data used for training the model was sourced from various public datasets, including:

1.Gutenberg Project
2.Wikipedia
3.Project Gutenberg
4.News Articles
